# E-COMMERCE-SITE
intership project \n
This repository hosts the code for an e-commerce website developed during an internship at Motilal Dulichand. Built using HTML and CSS, the project aims to provide a responsive and intuitive online shopping experience. Key features include product listings with sorting options, detailed product pages, a shopping cart, secure checkout functionality, and a combined login/register page. Additionally, comprehensive documentation in Microsoft Word format and a screen recording video demonstrating the website's functionality have been uploaded for reference. All code is maintained in the master branch of this repository. Feel free to clone the repository and explore the code to see how these features were implemented.
